<h2 align="left">Project Overview 🔎</h2>

###

<p align="left">This React.js-based project is designed to fetch and display exercise information from <b>ExerciseDB API</b> using a custom hook, tailored to <b>user input</b>. Each item retrieved from the ExerciseDB will <b>asynchronously fetch</b> related video content, providing users with alternative resources to enhance their fitness journey.</p>
<br>

###

<h2 align="left">Extra Features 🌟</h2>

-   Custom react hook to fetch ExerciseDB and Youtube options data at Exercises.jsx and SearchEngine.jsx components **( FetchData.js )**.
-   Hidden **sourcemap** production for minimized react structure on deploy to improve security and machine performance.

###

<h2 align="left">CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions 🔄</h2>

To further enhance the project, I have integrated **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** using **GitHub Actions**. This feature automates the deployment process, ensuring that updates are delivered efficiently and reliably.

### Benefits:
- **Faster Delivery**: Automating the deployment process reduces the time between code changes and live updates, allowing for quicker iterations and feedback.
- **Consistency**: A standardized build and deployment process minimizes the risk of human error, leading to more stable releases.
- **Scalability**: This CI/CD setup can be easily extended to include additional testing and deployment environments, supporting future growth and complexity of the project.
